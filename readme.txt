there would be the crud on the project table
and the crud based on the project name
when the user clicks on the project name in the project table
he can add the line items
before moving on to line items, he can set the margin percentage and also he can add the category(mandatory)
and on the line item page, he can add updates and delete the categories
category position can be saved by +1 and series would be like 1.1, 1.2 for category position 1.0
user can change the margin % whenever he wants to.
